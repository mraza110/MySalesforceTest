      This is my little paragraph about the branching strategy. These are the salient principles for us to follow:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>master</strong> should always store what exactly we have in production.</li>
        <li><strong>dev</strong> should be the in-development codebase the dev team uses.</li>
        <li><strong>feature branches</strong> should be created off of dev for any feature you work on.</li>
        <li><strong>release branches</strong> should be created off of dev for any releases.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
