    <b>CREATE A BRANCH:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Now a good prac is to always create a branch.</li>
      <li>To do that use the command git branch branchname so git branch dev</li>
      <li>Created a branch in working environment</li>
      <li>Than do git checkout dev -m”This is a dev branch”</li>
      <li>Commit the branch to staging</li>
      <li>Than do git push --set-upstream origin dev</li>
      <li>Push the branch to remote Repository</li>
      <li>Go to github and check .. under master you should see ur branch.</li>
      <li>A short form to this process is using the command git checkout -b my_branch</li>
      <li>Than go git push --set-upstream origin my_branch</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

      This is my little paragraph about the branching strategy. These are the salient principles for us to follow:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>master</strong> should always store what exactly we have in production.</li>
        <li><strong>dev</strong> should be the in-development codebase the dev team uses.</li>
        <li><strong>feature branches</strong> should be created off of dev for any feature you work on.</li>
        <li><strong>release branches</strong> should be created off of dev for any releases.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
